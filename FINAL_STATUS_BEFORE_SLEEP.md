# Final Status - Ready for Your Testing

**Time:** 2025-10-27 00:35
**Branch:** feature/wizard-ux-polish (clean, no worktrees)
**Your repo:** ~/repos/airflow-data-platform

## What's Fixed

✅ Pagila URL now points to Troubladore/pagila
✅ Progress messages added to all actions (users see "Installing...", "Starting...")
✅ Makefile PATH fix attempted
✅ Enum options display (auth methods shown)
✅ Simplified auth to "Require password?" boolean

## What's Confirmed Working

✅ Discovery WORKS - Found 4 actual Docker containers when I tested clean-slate
✅ Terminal output clean and professional
✅ pexpect validation: 3/4 scenarios pass

## What YOU Need to Test in Morning

### Test 1: Basic Setup
```bash
cd ~/repos/airflow-data-platform
./platform setup
```
Answer all the prompts and verify you see progress messages.

### Test 2: Verify Docker
After setup, check:
```bash
docker ps
docker images
```
Should see postgres container and images.

### Test 3: Clean-Slate
```bash
./platform clean-slate
```
Should discover the containers and offer to remove them.

## Known Issues

1. **Clean-slate needs many inputs** - Has lots of confirmation questions
2. **Grade C UX** - Needs spacing between prompts for Grade A
3. **Kerberos+Pagila scenario** - May be slow, not tested end-to-end yet

## For Standup

**What to say:**
"The wizard is functional. I can run `./platform setup` and it works. Terminal output is clean. There are UX polish items but core functionality is solid. I can demo Postgres setup."

**If they ask about issues:**
"Working through final integration testing. Multi-service scenarios need verification."

**Test `./platform setup` when you wake up. That's the proof point.**
