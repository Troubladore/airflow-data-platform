**Branch:** feature/wizard-ux-polish

## Testing Organization

### Fast Tests (< 30 sec each)
- Terminal output formatting
- Input validation
- Service selection logic
- Configuration file generation

### Medium Tests (30-120 sec each)
- Single service installation (Postgres, Kerberos, Pagila)
- Docker container verification
- Clean-slate discovery

### Slow Tests (2-10 min each)
- Multi-service combinations
- Image pulling (first time)
- Full setup + teardown cycles

## Test Results by Category

### 1. Terminal Output & UX ✅ ALL PASSING
- ✅ Prompts shown once (not duplicated)
- ✅ Boolean format [y/N] correct
- ✅ Variables interpolated (no {placeholders})
- ✅ Clean newlines between prompts
- ✅ Enum options displayed
- ✅ Progress messages shown
- ⚠️ Spacing could be better (Grade C → need A)

### 2. Interactive Input Collection ✅ ALL PASSING
- ✅ Wizard waits for user input
- ✅ Validation errors re-prompt
- ✅ Defaults work (press Enter)
- ✅ Custom values accepted
- ✅ Type conversion (string→int, string→bool)

### 3. Service Selection ✅ ALL PASSING
- ✅ Y/N questions for each service
- ✅ Postgres always enabled
- ✅ Selected services configured
- ✅ Unselected services skipped

### 4. PostgreSQL Installation 🟡 PARTIAL
- ✅ Container created (platform-postgres)
- ✅ Image pulled
- ✅ Service started
- ⚠️ Database init fails (but continues anyway)
- ❌ Not verifying postgres is actually accessible
- **Score: 3/5 working**

### 5. Kerberos Installation 🟡 PARTIAL
- ✅ Mock container created (kerberos-sidecar-mock)
- ✅ Auto-detects non-domain environment
- ✅ Creates mock ticket cache
- ❌ Not tested if packages actually installed
- ❌ Not verified container is functional
- **Score: 3/5 working**

### 6. Pagila Installation ⏳ TESTING
- ✅ Repository URL prompt works
- ❌ Not verified repo actually clones
- ❌ Not verified database schema created
- ❌ Not tested with actual postgres running
- **Score: 1/4 working - needs testing**

### 7. Discovery System ✅ ALL PASSING
- ✅ Finds Docker containers
- ✅ Finds Docker images
- ✅ Finds volumes
- ✅ Shows count to user
- ✅ Empty state handled gracefully

### 8. Configuration Management 🟡 PARTIAL
- ✅ platform-config.yaml created
- ✅ Config has correct structure
- ❌ Not verified config is actually used by services
- ❌ Not tested config regeneration
- **Score: 2/4 working**

### 9. Error Handling ❌ FAILING
- ❌ Init failures don't stop wizard
- ❌ No verification of success
- ❌ Says "complete" when things failed
- ❌ No rollback on errors
- **Score: 0/4 working - CRITICAL**

### 10. Clean-Slate Teardown ⏳ NOT TESTED
- ✅ Discovery works
- ❌ Actual removal not tested
- ❌ Verification not tested
- **Score: 1/3 working - needs testing**

## Overall Score: 48% Complete

**What works:** UI, input, selection, basic postgres
**What's broken:** Error handling, verification, some services
**What's untested:** Teardown, multi-service combos

## Test Queue (Prioritized)

### QUICK WINS (do first - 10min total)
1. Fix error handling (stop on critical failures)
2. Add success verification
3. Export missing functions

### MEDIUM (30min total)
4. Test Pagila actually works
5. Test Kerberos packages installed
6. Test clean-slate actually removes

### SLOW (2hr total)
7. All multi-service combinations
8. Custom image scenarios
9. Full setup→use→teardown cycle

## Parallel Testing Strategy

**Agent 1:** Terminal UX validation (pexpect)
**Agent 2:** Docker verification (containers/images)
**Agent 3:** Service functionality (postgres accessible, etc.)
**Agent 4:** Clean-slate teardown validation

All can run simultaneously on different test databases/containers.
