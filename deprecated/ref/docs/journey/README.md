# Journey (Greenfield → Production)

This is a **hands-on** journey guide. It assumes you’ve already installed commodity tools (WSL2, Docker Desktop, VS Code, pyenv, uv, pipx, ruff, dbt, Astro CLI, etc.) using standard vendor docs.

From here on, we focus on **what to accomplish**, **how to do it**, and **how to prove it works**, starting **locally** and then stepping up.
