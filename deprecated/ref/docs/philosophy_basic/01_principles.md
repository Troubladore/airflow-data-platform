# Core Principles

- **Developer Fidelity**: local should look and feel like production.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Bronze → Silver → Gold layering.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Dimensions live once, reused everywhere.
- **Modularity**: Datakits for Python-based ETL, dbt for SQL transforms.
- **Sustainability**: Reusable images, centralized TLS, repeatable bootstraps.
