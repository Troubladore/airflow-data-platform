# Current State - Complete Assessment

**Time:** 2025-10-27 01:00
**Branch:** feature/wizard-ux-polish
**Status:** NOT READY FOR DEMO

## What Was Discovered Through Real Testing

### ✅ What Actually Works
1. **Terminal UI** - Clean prompts, proper formatting, [y/N] format
2. **Input collection** - Waits for user, validates, re-prompts on errors
3. **Service selection** - Y/N questions work
4. **Config file creation** - platform-config.yaml gets written
5. **Progress messages** - Shows "Installing...", "Starting..."
6. **Discovery** - Finds existing Docker containers and artifacts

### ❌ What's Broken

**CRITICAL: Installation Doesn't Actually Happen**

**Test results:** 4/7 scenarios pass
- ✓ Postgres only works
- ✓ Postgres + Pagila works
- ✗ Kerberos doesn't actually install
- ✗ Custom images don't get pulled
- ✗ Some actions are stubs

**The Problem:** Wizard says "✓ Success" but services aren't actually running.

## Test Evidence

**Docker verification shows:**
- Postgres container gets created ✅
- Kerberos container does NOT get created ❌
- Custom images do NOT get pulled ❌
- Pagila works (uses existing postgres) ✅

**Wizard output says:**
```
✓ PostgreSQL started successfully
[OK] Setup complete!
```

**Reality:**
- Database init failed (but wizard continued)
- Kerberos not started (but wizard said complete)
- No verification that services work

## Root Causes

1. **Actions don't implement actual installation** - They're partially stubbed
2. **No verification** - Doesn't check if containers actually started
3. **Errors ignored** - init_database fails but wizard continues
4. **Missing infrastructure** - platform-infrastructure Makefile targets may not exist

## What Needs Fixing

### Must Fix:
1. Verify actions actually call correct make targets
2. Add error handling - STOP if critical steps fail
3. Verify services actually started before saying success
4. Test that underlying infrastructure (make targets) exists

### Can Wait:
- UX polish (spacing, headers)
- Grade A formatting
- Edge case handling

## For Your Standup

**Honest assessment:**
"The wizard UI works and looks professional. But I discovered through end-to-end testing that it doesn't actually install all services correctly. Postgres works, but Kerberos and custom configurations have issues. I need more time to wire up the actual installation logic."

**OR if you want to push back:**
"Not ready to demo. Found critical issues in integration testing. Need to verify actual Docker operations work, not just that the wizard completes."

## Next Steps

When you wake up, we need to:
1. Verify each service's make targets actually exist
2. Fix action implementations to call correct commands
3. Add verification that services started
4. Re-run deep testing until 7/7 pass

**Estimated time:** 2-4 hours to fix properly

**Don't demo until we verify services actually work.**
