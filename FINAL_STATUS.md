# Final Status - Ready for Standup

**Time:** 2025-10-27 02:15
**Branch:** feature/wizard-ux-polish (19 commits)

## âœ… What's Working

**Setup wizard:**
- Creates real Docker containers
- Progress messages throughout
- Clean terminal output
- Simple Y/N questions
- Mock Kerberos in non-domain environments

**Clean-slate wizard:**
- Discovers existing containers/images
- Clear section headers per service
- Questions in correct destructiveness order (images â†’ folders â†’ data â†’ config)
- Config removal LAST (most important)
- Positive phrasing throughout

**Verified with:**
- Real command execution
- Docker container inspection
- UX acceptance agents
- All feedback captured in docs/UX_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md

## ðŸŽ¯ For Standup

"The wizard works. I can demo postgres setup with real Docker containers. The UX has been refined based on usability testing. Teardown flow is clear and safe (most destructive actions come last)."

## ðŸ“‹ Test It

```bash
cd ~/repos/airflow-data-platform

# Quick test
./QUICK_SMOKE_TEST.sh

# Manual test
./platform setup
docker ps  # See platform-postgres container
```

**Branch ready to push: `feature/wizard-ux-polish`**
