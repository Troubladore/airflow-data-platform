# Proposed Restructuring: Simplify data-platform

## Previous Structure (Was Too Nested!)
```
data-platform/
â””â”€â”€ sqlmodel-workspace/        # Why this level?
    â””â”€â”€ sqlmodel-framework/    # The actual content
        â”œâ”€â”€ src/
        â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
        â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
        â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

Three levels deep to get to actual code! ðŸ¤¯

## Option 1: Move to Root (Simplest)
```
sqlmodel-framework/    # Direct at root
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

**Pros:**
- Super clear - the framework IS a core part of the platform
- Matches runtime-environments/ pattern (direct at root)
- Simplest possible structure

**Cons:**
- If we add more frameworks later, root could get cluttered

## Option 2: Remove One Level (Balanced)
```
data-platform/
â””â”€â”€ sqlmodel-framework/    # Remove "sqlmodel-workspace"
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
    â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
    â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

**Pros:**
- Still organized under data-platform/
- Removes unnecessary "workspace" concept
- Leaves room for future data platform components

**Cons:**
- Still one level of nesting

## Option 3: Rename to Match Purpose (Most Clear)
```
sqlmodel-framework/    # At root, clearly named
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â””â”€â”€ docs/
```
Or even simpler:
```
framework/    # Since it's THE framework for this platform
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

## âœ… Implemented Solution: Option 1

Moved `sqlmodel-framework` directly to the root because:
1. It's a core component, not a sub-component
2. It parallels `runtime-environments/` and `platform-bootstrap/`
3. The name is already clear and specific
4. Simpler is better

## Impact on Documentation

All references have been updated from:
- `data-platform/sqlmodel-workspace/sqlmodel-framework/`

To simply:
- `sqlmodel-framework/`

Much cleaner in documentation, imports, and mental model!
