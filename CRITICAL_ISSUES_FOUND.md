# Critical Issues Found - Must Fix Before Demo

**Tested:** 2025-10-27 00:45
**Method:** Actual Docker verification, not just wizard completion

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Wizard Says Success But Things Don't Work

### Issue 1: Database Init Fails But Wizard Continues
**What happens:**
```
Initializing PostgreSQL database...
‚úó Database initialization failed
Starting PostgreSQL service...
‚úì PostgreSQL started successfully
[OK] Setup complete!
```

**Problem:** Wizard says "Setup complete!" but database init FAILED. Container exists but postgres role doesn't exist - it's broken.

**Impact:** User thinks everything worked, tries to use it, fails

**Fix needed:** If critical steps fail, STOP the wizard and show error, don't continue

### Issue 2: No Verification of Success
**Problem:** Wizard doesn't verify containers are actually running and accessible
**Fix needed:** After starting services, verify they respond (e.g., `docker exec postgres psql --version`)

### Issue 3: Actions Fail Silently
**Problem:** `make -C platform-infrastructure init-db` fails but we just show checkmark and continue
**Fix needed:** Check return codes, stop on critical failures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: User Feedback Issues

### Issue 4: No Progress During Long Operations
**Fixed:** Added "Installing Pagila..." messages
**Status:** Partially done, needs testing

### Issue 5: Unclear What PostgreSQL Question Means
**User said:** "Is this for Pagila or platform?"
**Fix needed:** Better context or section headers

## üìã Testing Still Needed

1. **With Docker stopped** - Does wizard handle gracefully?
2. **Clean-slate actually removes** - Not just discovers
3. **Kerberos + Pagila** - Does this combo work end-to-end?
4. **Error recovery** - What if network fails during git clone?

## üéØ For Morning

**DON'T demo until:**
1. Database init success verified
2. Postgres actually accessible after setup
3. Error handling doesn't lie to users

**Current state:** Wizard runs but creates broken infrastructure.

**This is NOT ready. Needs real integration testing, not just "wizard completed".**
