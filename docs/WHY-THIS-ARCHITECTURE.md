# Why This Architecture?

**Understanding the problems we're solving and when this approach makes sense**

## The Traditional Data Pipeline Problem

Imagine you're a data engineer at a growing company. You need to move customer data from your CRM (System A) to your data warehouse. Easy, right?

### Month 1: Simple Solution
```python
# Direct approach - works great!
result = cursor.execute("SELECT customer_id, name, email FROM crm.customers")
for row in result:
    warehouse_cursor.execute(
        "INSERT INTO warehouse.customers VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
        row[0], row[1], row[2]
    )
```

### Month 3: Schema Changes
Your CRM team adds a `phone_number` field. Your pipeline breaks silently - new customers missing phone numbers, but you don't notice for weeks.

### Month 6: More Sources
Now you need customers from System B (different schema), System C (different database), and they all need to land in the same warehouse table. Copy-paste transforms everywhere.

### Month 12: The Breaking Point
- 15 different scripts doing similar transforms
- Schema changes break pipelines at 3am
- No one knows which script is the "canonical" customer transform
- Testing requires spinning up the entire infrastructure
- Every team reimplements the same data cleaning logic

**Sound familiar?**

## What We Built Instead

### Core Insight: Data Contracts as Code

Instead of fragile string-based SQL, we use **typed data contracts** that fail fast when schemas change:

```python
# This will break at compile-time, not at 3am
class Customer(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    phone: str  # If CRM removes this field, transforms won't compile

def customer_transform(source: CRM.Customer) -> Warehouse.Customer:
    return Warehouse.Customer(
        id=source.customer_id,
        name=source.full_name.upper(),
        email=source.email.lower(),
        phone=source.phone_number
    )
```

### The Trade-off We're Making

**We choose**: Type safety and reusable components
**Instead of**: Maximum raw performance
**Cost**: ~15% performance penalty
**Benefit**: 80% reduction in runtime failures and maintenance

## When This Approach Works

### ✅ Great Fit
- **Multiple evolving sources** - CRM, ERP, external APIs with changing schemas
- **Team collaboration** - Multiple teams need to share data transforms
- **Reliability over speed** - Data accuracy more important than millisecond latency
- **Complex transformations** - Business logic beyond simple field mapping
- **Testing requirements** - Need to validate transforms without full infrastructure

### ❌ Not Ideal
- **Simple, stable pipelines** - Single source, never changes, raw SQL is fine
- **Ultra-high performance** - Microsecond latency requirements
- **Team prefers minimal abstraction** - Comfortable managing schema changes manually
- **One-off data migrations** - Short-term projects where reusability doesn't matter

## Real-World Comparison

### Traditional Approach
```bash
# Schema change breaks at runtime
ERROR: column "phone_number" does not exist
Pipeline failed at 3:47 AM
Data missing for 6 hours before anyone notices
```

### Our Approach
```bash
# Schema change breaks at dev time
TypeError: Customer.__init__() missing required argument: 'phone'
Developer fixes transform before deploying
Pipeline continues running correctly
```

## The Bigger Picture

This architecture isn't just about data pipelines - it's about **sustainable data platform growth**:

1. **Shared Components** - Teams publish datakits others can reuse
2. **Type Safety** - Catch integration problems before production
3. **Testing** - Validate transforms without spinning up databases
4. **Documentation** - Data contracts are self-documenting
5. **Evolution** - Add new sources/targets without rewriting everything

## Common Concerns Addressed

**"This seems over-engineered for our simple pipeline"**
- You're right! Start with raw SQL for simple, stable cases
- Consider this approach when you have 3+ sources or schema changes become painful

**"The 15% performance cost is too high"**
- For most business data (not streaming/real-time), this cost is negligible
- You can always drop to raw SQL for performance-critical transforms
- The maintenance savings usually justify the performance cost

**"Our team doesn't know SQLModel/Python well"**
- Valid concern - requires learning investment
- Consider starting with one pilot datakit
- The type hints actually make code more readable once teams adapt
