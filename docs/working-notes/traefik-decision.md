# Traefik Decision: Keep for Production-Like Development

## ü§î The Question
Should we keep Traefik as part of our platform infrastructure?

## ‚úÖ YES - But with Clear Purpose

### Why Traefik Still Adds Value

#### 1. **Production-Like HTTPS Experience**
```yaml
# What you get with Traefik
https://airflow.localhost     # Production-like
https://registry.localhost    # Secure registry
https://flower.localhost       # Celery monitoring

# Without Traefik
http://localhost:8080         # Not production-like
http://localhost:5000         # Insecure registry
http://localhost:5555         # Different ports everywhere
```

#### 2. **Mirrors Production Architecture**
- **Local**: Traefik ‚Üí Astronomer services
- **Production**: Ingress Controller ‚Üí Astronomer services
- Same routing patterns, just different implementations

#### 3. **Certificate Management**
- Integrates with mkcert for trusted local HTTPS
- Developers test with real certificates
- Catches HTTPS-specific issues early

#### 4. **Multi-Service Development**
When running multiple services locally:
- Astronomer Airflow
- Local registry cache
- Mock services (Delinea, etc.)
- Additional tools (Flower, pgAdmin, etc.)

Traefik provides consistent access patterns via subdomains rather than port juggling.

### How Traefik Aligns with Astronomer

**Astronomer doesn't care about your reverse proxy**:
- Astronomer provides the services
- You choose how to expose them
- Traefik is just the front door

**In Kubernetes (Production)**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: astronomer-airflow
spec:
  rules:
  - host: airflow.company.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: astronomer-webserver
```

**Locally with Traefik**:
```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.airflow.rule=Host(`airflow.localhost`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.airflow.tls=true"
```

Same pattern, different implementation!

### The Simplified Approach

```yaml
# platform-bootstrap/traefik-simple.yml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v3.0
    ports:
      - "443:443"  # HTTPS only
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./certs:/certs:ro  # From mkcert
    networks:
      - astronomer_airflow_network  # Use Astronomer's network
```

Then Astronomer services just need labels:
```yaml
# In astronomer docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  webserver:
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.airflow.rule=Host(`airflow.localhost`)"
```

## üìä Decision Matrix

| Aspect | With Traefik | Without Traefik | Winner |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Production similarity | ‚úÖ HTTPS, subdomains | ‚ùå Different ports | Traefik |
| Complexity | Medium | Low | No Traefik |
| Developer experience | ‚úÖ Clean URLs | ‚ùå Port memorization | Traefik |
| Astronomer alignment | ‚úÖ Complements | ‚úÖ Not needed | Tie |
| Certificate testing | ‚úÖ Real certs | ‚ùå HTTP only | Traefik |

## üéØ Recommendation

**KEEP Traefik but SIMPLIFY**:

1. **Move to platform-bootstrap/**
   - It's developer enablement, not core platform

2. **Make it OPTIONAL**
   ```bash
   make start              # Basic (no Traefik)
   make start-with-https   # With Traefik + HTTPS
   ```

3. **Document the VALUE**
   - "Test with production-like HTTPS"
   - "Catch certificate issues early"
   - "Same subdomain patterns as production"

4. **Keep it THIN**
   - Just routing and HTTPS
   - No complex middleware
   - No custom plugins

## The Right Question

Not "Do we need Traefik?" but "Does Traefik help developers build production-ready code?"

**Answer**: Yes, by providing production-like HTTPS and routing patterns locally.

## Implementation

```
platform-bootstrap/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ traefik/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml     # Simple Traefik setup
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dynamic/               # Route configs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # "Why HTTPS matters locally"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile
‚îÇ   # make start              # Without Traefik
‚îÇ   # make start-with-https   # With Traefik
```

*Traefik stays, but as an optional production-similarity tool, not required infrastructure.*
