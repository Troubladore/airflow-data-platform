# Platform Infrastructure Configuration
# ======================================
# Shared foundational services for the data platform
# Copy this to .env and customize

# ==========================================
# PostgreSQL Configuration
# ==========================================
# Shared OLTP PostgreSQL for all platform services
# Contains multiple databases: openmetadata_db, airflow_db, etc.

# Admin password for platform_admin user
PLATFORM_DB_PASSWORD=changeme_platform_password

# Service user passwords (for init script to create service-specific users)
# IMPORTANT: These must match the passwords in each service's .env file!
OPENMETADATA_DB_PASSWORD=changeme_openmetadata_password
# AIRFLOW_DB_PASSWORD=changeme_airflow_password  # Future

# ==========================================
# Image Sources (For Corporate Environments)
# ==========================================
# Default: Public postgres:17.5-alpine from Docker Hub
# Corporate: Set to your Artifactory mirror

# Example corporate path (uncomment and customize):
# IMAGE_POSTGRES=artifactory.company.com/docker-remote/library/postgres:17.5-alpine

# ==========================================
# Notes
# ==========================================
#
# This PostgreSQL instance is for PLATFORM services only:
#   ✓ OpenMetadata metadata catalog (openmetadata_db)
#   ✓ Airflow metastore (airflow_db)
#   ✓ Future platform services
#
# NOT for:
#   ✗ Warehouse data (Bronze/Silver/Gold) - use separate instances
#   ✗ Application databases (like Pagila) - use separate instances
#
# Why separate?
#   - OLTP vs OLAP workloads have different performance characteristics
#   - Isolation prevents platform services from affecting data workloads
#   - Easier to scale warehouse independently
#
