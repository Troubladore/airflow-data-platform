# Wizard Test Results - Overnight Testing

**Tested:** 2025-10-27 00:30
**Branch:** feature/wizard-ux-polish
**Method:** pexpect (real terminal simulation)

## What Works

### ✅ Scenario 1: Postgres Only
**Command:** `./platform setup` with n,n,n,defaults
**Result:** PASS - Completes successfully
**Terminal output:** Clean, professional

### ✅ Scenario 2: Postgres + Kerberos
**Command:** `./platform setup` with n,y,n,defaults
**Result:** PASS - Completes successfully
**Prompts:** Postgres config → Kerberos domain → Kerberos image

### ✅ Scenario 3: Postgres + Pagila
**Command:** `./platform setup` with n,n,y,defaults
**Result:** PASS - Completes successfully
**Prompts:** Postgres config → Pagila repository URL

## What Needs Investigation

### ⚠️ Scenario 4: Postgres + Kerberos + Pagila
**Command:** `./platform setup` with n,y,y,defaults
**Result:** TIMEOUT after Pagila repository URL
**Issue:** May be actual installation running (cloning repo, creating DB)
**Next:** Test manually to see if it's just slow or actually broken

### ⚠️ Makefile Integration
**Command:** `make setup` from platform-bootstrap/
**Result:** Attempted fix to PATH issue
**Status:** Needs manual testing in real terminal
**Issue:** Make shell environment may not have .local/bin in PATH

## Known Issues Not Yet Fixed

1. **No spacing between prompts** - All prompts run together
2. **No section headers** - Can't tell when switching between services
3. **Password shows default** - Security concern
4. **No completion summary** - Doesn't show what was configured

## What to Test When You Wake Up

```bash
cd ~/repos/airflow-data-platform

# Test 1: Basic wizard (should work)
./platform setup
# Answer: n, n, n, then all defaults

# Test 2: From Makefile (PATH fix)
cd platform-bootstrap
make setup
# Same answers

# Test 3: Multiple services
./platform setup
# Answer: n, y, y (Kerberos + Pagila)
# See if it actually completes or hangs
```

## Current Grade: C (Functional but needs polish)

**Works:** Interactive input, service selection, basic scenarios
**Needs:** Spacing, headers, visual polish for Grade A

---

**Bottom line:** You can demo Postgres-only setup confidently. Multi-service needs verification.
