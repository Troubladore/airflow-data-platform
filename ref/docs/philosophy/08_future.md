# Future Considerations

- **Lineage**: Integrate OpenLineage for visibility across Airflow and dbt.
- **Type 2 Dims**: dbt snapshots for slowly changing dimensions.
- **Spark Scale-out**: Databricks/Snowpark in higher envs.
- **Governance**: enforced dbt tests, contract-based schemas.
- **CI/CD**: automated promotion of runner images and dbt packages.
