# Security Risk Exceptions
# Track accepted risks with justification and review dates
# Format: Each exception includes pattern, justification, accepted_by, date, expires

exceptions:
  # Exception 1: Documentation validation commands
  - pattern: "curl -k https://registry.localhost/v2/_catalog"
    category: "dynamic_downloads"
    justification: |
      WHAT: Testing command in validation documentation (validate-all.yml line 308)
      WHY FLAGGED: Scanner detects curl command as potential dynamic download
      WHY ACCEPTED: This is a documentation example showing users how to test their registry setup
      RISK LEVEL: None - command is in documentation comments, not executed during automation
      CONTEXT: Part of troubleshooting guide for manual verification after setup
    accepted_by: "Security Team"
    accepted_date: "2025-09-19"
    expires: "2026-03-19"  # 6 months out
    review_frequency: "biannual"

  # Exception 2: Package manager installations vs pipe-to-shell
  - pattern: "ansible/setup-wsl2.yml.*- curl"
    category: "dynamic_downloads"
    justification: |
      WHAT: Installing curl package via apt package manager (setup-wsl2.yml line 47)
      WHY FLAGGED: Scanner detects "curl" in dynamic downloads check
      WHY ACCEPTED: This is "apt install curl" (package manager) NOT "curl | bash" (pipe-to-shell)
      RISK LEVEL: Low - legitimate package installation through Ubuntu's package manager
      CONTEXT: curl package needed for various validation commands in the platform
    accepted_by: "Platform Team"
    accepted_date: "2025-09-19"
    expires: "2026-03-19"  # 6 months out
    review_frequency: "biannual"

  # Exception 3: False positive on certificate documentation
  - pattern: "key.*0600"
    category: "hardcoded_secrets"
    justification: |
      WHAT: Documentation mentioning "keys should be 0600" file permissions
      WHY FLAGGED: Scanner detects "key" pattern as potential hardcoded secret
      WHY ACCEPTED: This documents proper file permissions for certificate keys, not actual secrets
      RISK LEVEL: None - security documentation explaining best practices
      CONTEXT: Validation guidance showing users how to verify certificate permissions
    accepted_by: "Security Team"
    accepted_date: "2025-09-19"
    expires: "2026-03-19"  # 6 months out
    review_frequency: "biannual"

  # Exception 4: Scanner meta-patterns (business decision)
  - pattern: "scan-supply-chain.sh"
    category: "dynamic_downloads"
    justification: |
      WHAT: Security scanner code containing references to "curl | bash" patterns
      WHY FLAGGED: Scanner finds its own code discussing pipe-to-shell security patterns
      WHY ACCEPTED: This is the scanner's source code discussing security - not executing dangerous commands
      RISK LEVEL: None - meta-discussion of security patterns in security tool code
      CONTEXT: Business decision to accept scanner self-references rather than complex pattern exclusions
      TECHNICAL_DEBT: Consider improving pattern matching to exclude scanner source files
    accepted_by: "Security Team"
    accepted_date: "2025-09-19"
    expires: "2025-12-19"  # 3 months - shorter cycle for technical debt
    review_frequency: "quarterly"

  # Exception 5: Documentation examples for risk acceptance framework
  - pattern: "SECURITY-RISK-ACCEPTANCE.md"
    category: "unpinned_dependencies"
    justification: |
      WHAT: Documentation examples showing "pip install safety ruff semgrep" without version pins
      WHY FLAGGED: Scanner detects unpinned pip install commands in documentation
      WHY ACCEPTED: These are examples teaching proper exception format - not executed commands
      RISK LEVEL: None - documentation examples showing how to document risks
      CONTEXT: Meta-documentation about the risk acceptance process itself
    accepted_by: "Security Team"
    accepted_date: "2025-09-19"
    expires: "2025-12-19"  # 3 months - review documentation patterns
    review_frequency: "quarterly"
