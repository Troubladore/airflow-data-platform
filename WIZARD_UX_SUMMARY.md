Which services do you need for local development?
Does your organization use corporate infrastructure?
```

Enable OpenMetadata? [y/N]:
Configure corporate infrastructure? [y/N]:
```

**Most common terms:**
- **OpenMetadata** (15x) - Should explain: "data catalog tool"
- **Kerberos** (10x) - Should explain: "secure authentication"
- **Artifactory** (3x) - Should explain: "corporate Docker registry"
- **OLTP** (2x) - Should say: "transactional database"
- **kinit** (3x) - Should say: "(Kerberos login command)"

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Critical)

   - Use `ask_yes_no()` function consistently
   - Estimated time: 30 minutes

2. **Explain jargon on first mention**
   - OpenMetadata ‚Üí "Data catalog tool"
   - Kerberos ‚Üí "Secure authentication"
   - OLTP ‚Üí "transactional database"
   - Add (explanation) after first use
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### Should Fix (High Priority)

3. **Add context to progress messages**
   - "Starting services..." ‚Üí "Starting infrastructure (PostgreSQL, network)..."
   - Estimated time: 30 minutes

4. **Add help text in welcome**
   ```
   Press Enter to accept defaults (shown in CAPS like [y/N])
   Technical terms are explained when first introduced
   ```
   - Estimated time: 15 minutes

## Impact Analysis

**Current State:**
- Technical users: Can navigate easily
- Non-technical users: May be confused by jargon and format

**After Fixes:**
- Technical users: No change (still easy)
- Non-technical users: Much clearer, more accessible
- Overall grade: Should improve from C (72) to B+/A- (85-90)

## Test Method

**Automated pexpect testing with manual grading:**
1. Run wizard with 3 different scenarios
2. Capture full terminal output
3. Analyze against 5 UX criteria
4. Assign weighted scores
5. Calculate letter grade

**Tools:**
- pexpect 4.9.0
- Python 3.12
- subprocess module
- NO_COLOR=1 for clean output

**Reproducible:**
```bash
python3 platform-bootstrap/tests/test-wizard-ux-manual.py
```

- **Raw Outputs:** `/tmp/wizard_output_*.txt`

**Bottom Line:**
The wizard is functionally solid but needs better formatting ([y/N]) and jargon explanations to be accessible to all users. Estimated fix time: 2-4 hours to raise grade from C to B+.
